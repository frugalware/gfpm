- We can create a 'Not installed packages' entry in our combobox. How can be ?
  Well give for the reponame some like: "frugalware-current-ni" then check for
  that in treeview group loading function, if reponam is frugalware-current-ni
  then setup an integer, write back reponame to frugalware-current and then
  just do an if else at treeview loading (we can figure out which package installed
  and which not, so we can deal what we want to display.

  Another way, Bring some global variable to somewhere, which can be reach from
  treeview_group but can be set in the treeview_group loading functions some like:
  int notinstalled = 0; (this is extern or it will be in .h somewhere)
  And now when Not installed packages triggered via combobox, then set notinstalled=1
  and check in group treeview function for it. Maybe it is better, because we can deal
  with custom repos or file based repos too.

- Support for reading repos from pacman conf

- Rewrite or redesign all dialog_* callback and window to support dialog titles
  can be done such: 
  foo_dialog_run(char *foobar) -> foo_dialog_run(char *foobar, char *title)
  Then we can set up our titles for every dialogs, because now there are tons of
  untitled dialogs which looks ugly :)
