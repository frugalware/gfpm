GFpm README
=============

GFpm stands for Graphical Frugalware package manager.

GFpm is NOT a front-end to pacman-g2. It uses the libpacman library 
(provided by pacman-g2) as it's backend. Gfpm is written in C using the
GTK+2 Toolkit.

A short list of features:
- It's faster than frugalpkg or other frontends to pacman-g2
- Includes a repository manager for managing multiple repositories
- The repository manager also features a server manager to manage
  servers for repositories
- Ability to search packages across multiple repositories
- Features a database optimizer based on pacman-g2-optimize to speed up
  package operations
- Built-in log viewer to keep track of package operations
- Includes a README viewer for packages that install a README.Frugalware
- Gfpm provides detailed information about a package like group
  information, size, packager, files etc. It also displays a package's
  Changelog.
- Integration with GNOME and XFCE using nautilus and thunar plugins (optional)

Requirements
============

Gfpm requires the following packages :

- gtk+2 >= 2.10
- pacman-g2 >= 3.7.0
- frugalwareutils >= 0.7.9
- inotify-tools (opitional)

For the nautilus extension (optional), you'll require the following packages:

- nautilus >= 2.13.3

For the thunar plugin (optional), you'll require the following packages:

- thunar >= 0.9.0

Installation
============

unpack and run the following command(s):

$ ./configure

or 

$ ./configure --enable-nautilus-extension

for GNOME integration

or

$ ./configure --enable-thunar-plugin

for XFCE integration

If this completes without any errors, run the make command as shown
below in order to compile gfpm.

$ make

And finally, run make install as root to install gfpm.

$ make install

Read the INSTALL file for more details.

(NOTE: Gfpm includes an experimental component called the 'iconcache monitor' 
 which monitors the /usr/share/icons directory for changes and updates
 the hicolor iconcache if the directory is updated by a package
 operation. This feature was added because some package might install
 icons in the directory but not update the iconcache. So gfpm takes care
 of it. If you wish to use/test this component, run the configure script
 with the --enable-icmonitor argument)
